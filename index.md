## PICI Data Resources on COVID-19

SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is an ongoing worldwide viral pandemic. To help accelerate research in this area, the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and our affiliated researchers are opening up existing and new datasets related to COVID-19. Our goal with this aligns with our overall goals at PICI: to make data accessible to the research community around the world so we can collaborate and move research forward more quickly. For questions or support, please email [data@parkerici.org](mailto:data@parkerici.org). To learn more about the PICI, visit [parkerici.org](parkerici.org).
